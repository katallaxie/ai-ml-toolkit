# 🛠️ AI/ML Toolkit

## 👋 Welcome

This repository is designed to help engineers and non-engineers build production-grade AI/ML applications. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and best practices that I have found useful. I hope you find it useful too!

## 🏎️ Getting Started

> This is a currated list of projects and services that I have found useful.

Contributions to the toolkit are warm welcome.

## 📚 Reading & Learning

[![[1hr Talk] Intro to Large Language Models](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zjkBMFhNj_g/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g)

> You can learn more about the internals of an LLM by the full defintion of a model [here](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT/blob/master/mingpt/model.py).
> There is more about to learn the transformer architecture in the [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper.

## 👨‍💻 Private AI

- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) - A project to build a very large language model that is open source and can be run on a personal computer. #opensource
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) - Get up and running with large language models locally.
- [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) - An extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted AI platform designed to operate entirely offline. #opensource
- [Jan](https://jan.ai/) - Run LLMs like Mistral or Llama2 locally and offline on your computer, or connect to remote AI APIs. [#opensource](https://github.com/janhq/jan)
- [Msty](https://msty.app/) - A straightworward and powerful interface for local and online AI models.
- [PyGPT](https://pygpt.net/) - Personal desktop AI assistant with chat, vision, agents, image generation, tools and commands, voice control and more. #opensource

> Recommendation: If you start today, use [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) to serve your models locally.

## 📝 Prompt Engineering

- [LangChain](https://langchain.org/) - A platform for building and deploying AI models with a focus on prompt engineering. #opensource
- [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) - A framework for building end-to-end search pipelines with question-answering, document search, and more. #opensource
- [DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/) - A Python library for building and deploying AI models with a focus on prompt engineering. #opensource
- [Agenta](https://www.agenta.ai/) - A platform for building and deploying AI models with a focus on prompt engineering.
